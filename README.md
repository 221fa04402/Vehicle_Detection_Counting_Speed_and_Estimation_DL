# Vehicle_Detection_Counting_Speed_and_Estimation_DL


This project uses a video file as input and a YOLO model (yolov8n.pt) for detection. These files are not included directly in the GitHub repo because they are large.

If you see a "file not found" error:
Download the files manually from the given links.
On GitHub, click "View Raw" on the file, then right-click and choose “Save As” to download it properly.
Make sure to place the files in the same folder as the code or as shown in the project structure.
